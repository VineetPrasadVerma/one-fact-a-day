You are helping create YouTube Shorts for a channel called "1 Fact a Day".

Write a script for a 30-second short video. The script should:
- Start with a hook like "Did you know..." or "Here's a crazy fact..."
- Be factual, interesting, and engaging
- Use simple, friendly language
- End with a soft call-to-action like "Follow for more daily facts!"

Only output the 3‚Äì5 sentence script. Do NOT include hashtags, notes, or explanations.
